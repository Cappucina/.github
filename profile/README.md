## About the Usage of AI in Cappucina

Cappucina is primarily against the usage of AI for code generation. AI should and will only be used for learning and getting a deeper understanding at topics. If you believe a portion of our code was generated by AI, please provide us details (who published the commit with that specific code segment, file name, etc.) and we will take actions to fixing it. Thank you!

## Projects by Cappucina
- The [ADAN](https://github.com/Cappucina/ADAN.git) programming language.
- An [ADAN language server](https://github.com/Cappucina/ADAN-VSC-LSP.git) for obtaining syntax highlighting, code snippets, and tab completion for ADAN.
